				<![CDATA[<div class="feed-description"><p><img src="http://www.ejc2014.org/images/pwb.jpg" border="0" alt="Performers Without Borders" title="Performers Without Borders" align="right" style="float: right; border: 0; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" />Following a pretty rushed version of the original EJC 2014 app back in July of last year, Brendan finally got around to what he's been meaning to do, which is to extract the EJC-specific configuration from the rest of the code. Through the use of dependencies and product flavours (or 'flavors', as these crazy Americans say), it should now be possible to spin up new versions of the app, configured for entirely different events with different calendars and RSS feeds.</p>

				<![CDATA[<div class="feed-description">This is a project that could really grow legs. At the moment only Google Calendar and RSS feeds are supported, for schedule and news, respectively. But support for other feed types/sources could easily be added. A button to add events from the schedule to the user's calendar (a la Google I/O app) would be good. A generic Twitter feed page could be good too, with sharing options and all. Plenty of room to grow.</div>]]>

			<title>Breaking News: Brendan Not A Designer</title>

				<![CDATA[<div class="feed-description">So, it turns out that Brendan is not, in fact, a designer. He has a pretty good idea of the material design guidelines at this stage, and with AppCompat libraries and all the rest of it, it's easy enough to go along with, but actual visual design is not exactly Brendan's forte. As you may have guessed from the state of his face/head/clothes, presentation is not his strong suit. There's definitely room for a clothes/suit pun in there. It's planned for a future version.
